# Employee-Tracker


## Description
 
Command line application that allows a user to interact with an employee database. Users can view all employees/departments/roles, update all employees/departments/roles, and delete all employees/departments/roles. The user will invoke the app and the follow the prompts and the app will perform the task.


## Code and Tech

I utilized VS Code in order to create js files to create the application. Inquirer, mysql, console table, and sequelize were used to create the prompts in the command line. Node was used to run the application.


## Features

Applied functions and concepts recently learned to create command line application connected to a database.

The user can add, delete, and update the employees, departments, and roles in the database.
-Invoke app by typing node server.js in the integrated terminal
-Choose a selection from the menu using the arrow keys
-Follow the prompts accordingly to add/delete/update
-Run the program again to choose a new selection

The app will then run and perform the task the user selects
